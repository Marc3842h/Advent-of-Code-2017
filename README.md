# Advent of Code 2017

This is my try at the [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.
I'll be coding all challenges in Python 3.

Each day will have its own directory with the challenges, input etc.
in it. Please take a look if you dare.

I won't participate for the Leaderboard as these challenges get
released on **6 am (CET)**, and I'm only 14 years of age and still
need my sleep and be prepared for school and stuff.
